# Java Todo List App

## Overview

This repository contains the source code for a simple Todo List application written in Java. The application follows the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture and incorporates the Observer and Singleton design patterns to enhance maintainability and scalability.

## Features

- **MVC Architecture:** The application is organized into three main components - Model, View, and Controller, promoting a clean separation of concerns.

- **Observer Pattern:** The Observer pattern is employed to enable efficient communication between the model and the views. Views are notified whenever the underlying data in the model changes, ensuring real-time updates.

- **Singleton Design Pattern:** The Singleton pattern is utilized to ensure that there is only one instance of the TodoListManager, maintaining a single point of control for managing the list of tasks.

## Usage

- Upon running the application, you'll be presented with a simple command-line interface for managing your todo list.

- Use the provided commands to add tasks, mark tasks as completed, view the todo list, and exit the application.
